Demo Input:

Click and drag (RMB/MMB) to pan the camera around the current scene environment. Alternatively, the I,J,K & L keys may be used as well.

Click to select a GameObject in the hierarchy. There is also a filter at the top of the hierarchy avaliable. Filters in place checking for names and for components. A GameObject can be selected via clicking its name in the hierarchy or by mouse picking it in the GameWindow.

Change the position, and scale of the GameObject via the Inspector or through dragging the mouse along the gizmos that appers when the GameObject is picked.
A game object can be cloned by right clicking on its name in the hierarchy, then selecting the "Duplicate" option.

Press CTRL+S to save the current level state to a file.

Close and reopen the application and the level (provided you did not rename it) will load as it was when you saved it.

Press the ' \ ' key to hide the logger.

Note that the Camera object should not be deleted, as doing so may cause strange behaviour on the Camera, amounting to a crash, unless doing mouse picking on the game window.
